# Website

This is my website to be used for blogging, hosting my work, and other fun things.

## Technologies

The design of the site is straightforward, using common web technologies such as:

- [Next.js][next-js] handles the bulk of the website's functionality
  - [React.js][react-js] runs "underneath the hood" of Next.js
- [TypeScript][typescript] is a fancy superset of JS with types (that simply transpiles back to JS)
- [TailwindCSS][tailwind-css] makes it look hip and semi-cool
